- Intro
  -> quickly show good javascript then bad javascript (for a laugh)?
  -> Who am I and establish credentials 
  -> Let's talk about what good JavaScript is. What are your thoughts? Throw some things out there.
		-> readable
		-> follows best practices and design patterns
		-> accurate and stable, repellant of accidental errors
  -> How many of you have used CoffeeScript some? Who has used it a lot? Hopefully, everyone 
     here will find something interesting in this talk, but it certainly is geared more towards those
     that have never used CoffeeScript or that have not used it all that much as of yet. 	 
  -> How many of you have read JavaScript the Good Parts?
	    -> Were going to talk some about how CoffeeScript makes it easier to stick to the good parts
		-> Will talk a little about what CoffeeScript is and the core goals of it, which make it
		   different than the other options out there (This is the "Bold")
		-> And we'll talk about the syntatic sugar that CoffeeScript gives us that makes our lives
           as developers easy in a lot of different ways.
		-> Along the way we will look at several real world examples and different development environments
           including Node, Visual Studio, WebKit, and Anvil.js.		
  (show good JavaScript according to "The good parts"
  -> Refer to Good...
     -> Talk about the good parts, Elijah's series, others?
	    http://oreilly.com/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/awful-parts.html
     -> closures (protect global state)
     -> truthy/falsy
- What is CoffeeScript?
  -> Refer to bold... (compiling JS? Not extremely new, but more compilers have syntax that's much different)
  -> It's just JavaScript (with Sugar)
- What the advantages?
  -> Refer to Sugar... (with pictures)
   -> Compare CoffeeScript to equivalent JavaScript (less code)
   -> more readable 
   -> significant whitespace, classes, lots of symbols to reduce code, string interpolation, etc.
- What are the disadvantages?
   -> A case against CoffeeScript ( http://ryanflorence.com/2011/2012/case-against-coffeescript/ )
- Gettings started (understanding the basics)
- CoffeeScript and external libraries like jQuery and jQuery UI (with examples)
- CoffeeScript for unit testing (do I have CoffeeSpec done by then?
- What tools can help (Visual Studio Workbench, Anvil, WebKit, Node.js support, more...)
- This is not an excuse for not learning JavaScript
- Where to go to get started and/or for more info (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/, Trevor's book, CoffeeScript Koans)
